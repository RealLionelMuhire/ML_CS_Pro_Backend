User Story: CEO of ML Corporate Services Software Application

As the CEO of ML Corporate Services, I need a comprehensive software application that provides streamlined client management, secure data handling, efficient collaboration, and user-friendly interfaces to enhance our services and compliance. The application should offer the following features:

I. Client Data Management:

Centralized Repository: The application should serve as a centralized repository for storing client data, including demographics and related files, ensuring data is organized and easily accessible.

Admission Process: It should support the admission (acceptance) process for clients who will be served by the company.

Permission Management: Allow administrators to set granular permissions based on user roles, ensuring that each user can perform specific tasks.

Client Documentation: Admins should be able to create structured and organized documentation for each client file, including time tracking for document creation.

Collaboration: Enable secure collaboration among administrators, facilitating the sharing of client data, notes, alerts, and payment plans within the system.

Alarming and Alerts: Provide alarms and alerts for due deadlines, such as passport expiration, subscription deadlines, and other client-related events.

Data Extraction: Allow data extraction for further analysis, promoting data-driven decision-making.

Security and Privacy: Incorporate robust security measures, including user authentication, access controls, and data encryption, to protect client information and maintain regulatory compliance.

Audit Trail: Implement an audit trail feature to log and save user and admin activities for security measures and audit purposes.

Work Done Tracker: Enable admins to track and log their work for client accounts, ensuring transparency and accountability in service delivery.
